## Core Features

### Language Management
- Support for unlimited dynamic languages with properties: name, language code, flag emoji, text direction (LTR/RTL), gradient colors, ordering field (integer rank), and creation timestamp
- Pre-seeded with 7 languages: English, Turkish, Spanish, Arabic, German, Japanese, and French
- Turkish is the first and default target language in all listings and selectors with ordering rank 1
- Russian language completely removed from backend storage, frontend UI, seed data, and selectors
- English is included as a selectable language with its own vocabulary set across four difficulty levels
- Admin-only language creation with instant UI reflection
- Each language includes sample vocabulary words loaded from external JSON files
- Languages are always sorted by ordering field (ascending) across all frontend displays
- Admin can edit language ordering with immediate persistence and UI updates

### Full Language Lifecycle Management
- Admin can add new languages with complete metadata (name, code, flag emoji, text direction, gradient colors, ordering)
- Admin can remove entire languages including all associated words with confirmation dialog
- Language removal includes language-scoped word deletion and immediate cache invalidation
- Admin can import words for any language via JSON using existing optimized import flow
- All language operations reflect immediately across Admin Panel, Home Page, and Language Page
- Language ordering persisted in stable storage and enforced across all frontend queries

### Vocabulary System
- Words stored with English translation, foreign language text, difficulty level (Beginner/Medium/Hard/Advanced), up to 5 example sentences per word, and timestamps
- Words are associated with specific languages
- Vocabulary data loaded from external JSON files during deployment or admin-triggered seeding
- JSON files contain structured vocabulary data with proper validation
- For English language entries, both english and foreign fields contain the same English word
- Words are searchable and filterable by difficulty level
- Backend optimized for scalable storage and query patterns supporting 10,000+ words with indexing by language and difficulty

### JSON Vocabulary Import System
- Frontend performs complete JSON parsing and validation before sending to backend
- Backend provides `bulkImportWords` function that accepts arrays of Word records in batches (200-500 words per call)
- Words are persisted to stable map storage in efficient batch operations
- Each word is added only once per language, with updates overwriting existing entries by English word
- Admin panel processes large vocabulary files by splitting into batches and sending multiple backend calls
- Single progress indicator shows overall import completion without per-item UI re-renders
- Import confirmation displays count of words successfully imported with timing information
- Graceful error handling for malformed JSON or import failures
- Success toasts display format: "✅ Imported 150 words in 1.2s"

### Language-Scoped Word Management
- Backend provides `removeWordsByLanguage` function that accepts a language name parameter
- Function safely iterates through stored words, collecting IDs of words matching the specified language name
- Uses two-pass deletion: first collect word IDs to delete, then remove them in a second pass to avoid mutation-while-iterating errors
- Includes proper existence checks to prevent exceptions when no words match the filter
- Backend provides `removeAllWords` function for global word deletion (all languages)
- Admin panel "Remove All Words" action requires selecting a specific language from dropdown
- Language-scoped deletion shows confirmation dialog clearly stating which language will be wiped
- Success toast displays: "🗑️ All [Language Name] words removed successfully"
- After deletion, automatically refetches words for both admin panel and user-facing language tabs for instant UI updates

### User Progress Tracking
- Track user statistics: total correct answers, total questions answered, current streak, last played time
- Badge system for achievements
- Progress data persisted per user principal

### Admin Authentication System
- Username/password authentication for admin panel access
- Login form with username and password fields
- Authentication state persists during session using local storage
- Friendly error message for invalid credentials: "Invalid username or password"
- Admin authentication is separate from regular user authentication flows
- Once authenticated, admin has full access to admin panel features

Turkish is prioritized as the first language with the following properties:
- name: "Turkish"
- code: "tr"
